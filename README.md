# Introduction
Every online Q&A website faces the issue of duplicate questions. In our project we take this NLP problem, evaluate and apply techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not.

Our work will be divided into following modules
* Data processing: Tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatization.
* Evaluation and selection of word representation techniques between word2vec or GloVe
* Evaluation of classical ML techniques such as Random Forests and SVM
* Evaluation of deep learning techniques for text classification such as RNN
